# Transport Fail-Mode Matrix

**Status:** v0.1 (audit of existing behavior, not a design proposal)
**Source:** PRD-004. Pipeline at `governance/pipeline.go`.
**Audience:** security reviewers, acquirers, on-call engineers.

This document specifies the exact fail-open / fail-closed behavior of the GIL
governance pipeline for each supported transport and each fault class. It
records what the code **does today**, with source citations. Recommendations
for production defaults are in §3; known gaps are in §6.

**Path conventions:** unqualified `pipeline.go` citations refer to
`governance/pipeline.go`. Adapter citations use the full repo-relative path
(`adapters/<transport>/adapter.go`). Test citations use the full path
(`governance/pipeline_test.go`, `governance/pipeline_coverage_test.go`).

## 1. Pipeline Fail-Mode Architecture

`Pipeline.Evaluate` runs four stages in sequence and always emits exactly one
audit event via a deferred hook (`pipeline.go:118-130`). The staging is:

| # | Stage | Location | Error behavior |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Trust Check | `pipeline.go:132-150` | **Always fail-closed.** Trust error → deny (`pipeline.go:136-140`). Agent in `ISOLATED`/`TERMINATED` state → deny (`pipeline.go:141-146`). `EVALUATING` state proceeds with trust score 0.5 (`pipeline.go:147-149`). No per-transport override. Stage is skipped entirely when `trustChecker == nil` or `req.AgentID == ""`. |
| 2 | Static Policies | `pipeline.go:152-165` | **No error path.** Glob matching via `path.Match` discards the match error (`pipeline.go:80-89`); malformed patterns are treated as non-matching rather than crashing the pipeline. |
| 3 | Domain Interceptors | `pipeline.go:167-181` | **Always fail-closed.** Interceptor returns an error → deny with reason `interceptor error: %v` (`pipeline.go:169-173`). Interceptor returns `{Allowed: false}` uses its own action/reason; empty action defaults to `deny` (`pipeline.go:174-181`). |
| 4 | PolicyEval | `pipeline.go:183-215` | **Per-transport configurable.** Evaluator error → deny only if `req.Transport` is in `PipelineConfig.FailClosedTransports` (`pipeline.go:189-193`). Otherwise the error is swallowed and the pre-existing `allow` default is returned (`pipeline.go:194-195`). |

Every decision emitted by `Pipeline.Evaluate` now carries an explicit
`decision_mode` label (see `governance/decision_mode.go`, PRD-002). The
four modes are mutually exclusive:

| Mode | Who sets it | When |
|---|---|---|
| `deterministic` | GIL pipeline | Default for every stage below; static-rule matches, trust outcomes, interceptor outcomes, `ActionDeny`/`ActionWarn`/`ActionRequireApproval`, evaluator errors (fail-closed or fail-open), and the no-match default allow. |
| `classified` | GIL pipeline | Only PolicyEval `ActionEscalate`, because escalation implies a semantic condition the evaluator could not resolve deterministically. |
| `proved` | Upstream Foundry (fulcrum-io) | Set when a Lean 4 invariant has discharged the decision. GIL itself never emits this mode. |
| `human_approved` | Upstream Foundry (fulcrum-io) | Set when a human reviewer has approved the action. GIL itself never emits this mode. |

Per-stage citations: the default value is initialized where `decision` is
constructed (`governance/pipeline.go:161`); the single `classified` override
is in the `ActionEscalate` branch of Stage 4
(`governance/pipeline.go:255`). The decision-mode field is propagated to
the audit event by `emitAudit` (`governance/pipeline.go:283`), so audit
sinks can aggregate or filter by epistemic confidence level.

The defer-emit hook at `pipeline.go:118-130` is the only place a decision can
be reshaped:

1. `decision.Duration` is recorded.
2. `p.emitAudit(...)` publishes the **original** action to the auditor.
3. **Then** — and only then — if `p.dryRun && decision.Action == "deny"`, the
   action is rewritten to `allow`, `decision.DryRun = true`, and the original
   reason is prefixed with `DRY-RUN would deny:`.

This ordering guarantees that the audit log always reflects what governance
would have blocked, even when dry-run flips the caller-visible action.

## 2. Fail-Mode Matrix

Seven fault classes × six transports. Each cell is one of:

- **DENY** — pipeline sets `decision.Action = "deny"`.
- **ALLOW** — pipeline leaves the default `decision.Action = "allow"`.
- **PASS** — pipeline is not involved; downstream error is surfaced by the
  caller's runtime unchanged.
- **ERR→caller** — adapter `ParseRequest` returns a Go error; the embedding
  runtime (mcpproxy, agent runtime, sandbox runtime) decides what the caller
  sees. Functionally the tool call does not proceed, which is equivalent to
  deny — but the decision and audit event are **not** produced by the GIL
  pipeline.
- **HTTP 400 / codes.Internal** — adapter surfaces a protocol-specific
  fail-closed error before pipeline entry.

| Fault Class | MCP | CLI | Code Exec | gRPC | A2A | Webhook |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trust store unreachable | DENY `pipeline.go:136-140` | DENY `pipeline.go:136-140` | DENY `pipeline.go:136-140` | DENY `pipeline.go:136-140` | DENY `pipeline.go:136-140` | DENY `pipeline.go:136-140` |
| Agent ISOLATED or TERMINATED | DENY `pipeline.go:141-146` | DENY `pipeline.go:141-146` | DENY `pipeline.go:141-146` | DENY `pipeline.go:141-146` | DENY `pipeline.go:141-146` | DENY `pipeline.go:141-146` |
| Adapter parse failure | ERR→caller `adapters/mcp/adapter.go:44-64` | ERR→caller `adapters/cli/adapter.go:52-82` | ERR→caller `adapters/codeexec/adapter.go:52-79` | `codes.Internal` `adapters/grpc/adapter.go:141-143` | ERR→caller `adapters/a2a/adapter.go:51-73` | HTTP 400 `adapters/webhook/adapter.go:139-143` |
| Interceptor error | DENY `pipeline.go:169-173` | DENY `pipeline.go:169-173` | DENY `pipeline.go:169-173` | DENY `pipeline.go:169-173` | DENY `pipeline.go:169-173` | DENY `pipeline.go:169-173` |
| PolicyEval error (transport in `FailClosedTransports`) | DENY `pipeline.go:189-193` | DENY `pipeline.go:189-193` | DENY `pipeline.go:189-193` | DENY `pipeline.go:189-193` | DENY `pipeline.go:189-193` | DENY `pipeline.go:189-193` |
| PolicyEval error (transport NOT in `FailClosedTransports`) | ALLOW `pipeline.go:194-195` | ALLOW `pipeline.go:194-195` | ALLOW `pipeline.go:194-195` | ALLOW `pipeline.go:194-195` | ALLOW `pipeline.go:194-195` | ALLOW `pipeline.go:194-195` |
| Downstream tool error (5xx / non-zero exit) | PASS `adapters/mcp/adapter.go:86-88` | PASS `adapters/cli/adapter.go:120-122` | PASS `adapters/codeexec/adapter.go:112-114` | PASS `adapters/grpc/adapter.go:97-99` | PASS `adapters/a2a/adapter.go:89-92` | PASS `adapters/webhook/adapter.go:100-102` |

**Notes on the matrix:**

- **Adapter parse failure** happens BEFORE the pipeline runs. No audit event
  is emitted by the pipeline in this case, because `Evaluate` is never
  called. The gRPC and webhook adapters embed pipeline invocation in their
  own HTTP/gRPC handlers (`adapters/grpc/adapter.go:131-157`,
  `adapters/webhook/adapter.go:128-177`), which is why they can map
  parse errors to protocol-level fail-closed responses (`codes.Internal`,
  HTTP 400). MCP, CLI, CodeExec, and A2A adapters only provide parsing; the
  embedding runtime (mcpproxy, agent runtime, sandbox runtime, A2A caller)
  is responsible for translating a parse error into a protocol response.

- **PolicyEval error (fail-open row)** is the only cell in the entire matrix
  where the GIL default behavior is ALLOW on error. This is why
  `FailClosedTransports` exists — it lets operators flip this row to DENY
  per security-critical transport.

- **Downstream tool error (PASS row)**: every `ForwardGoverned` method on
  every adapter is a no-op or stub. Forwarding is the responsibility of the
  surrounding runtime (mcpproxy, agent runtime, sandbox runtime, gRPC
  interceptor chain, webhook `Handler()`). The governance decision is
  emitted before forwarding happens, so downstream 5xx or non-zero exit does
  not retroactively change the action in the audit event.

## 3. Recommended `FailClosedTransports` Defaults

`PipelineConfig.FailClosedTransports` is `nil` by default
(`pipeline.go:19-21`), which means **all transports fail-open on PolicyEval
errors unless operators opt in**. Recommended production defaults below. This
is a recommendation, not an enforced policy — the pipeline ships with the
empty default.

| Transport | Recommended | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `TransportMCP` | **fail-closed** | Model-facing tool surface; silently allowing on evaluator outage means the governance layer degrades to the pre-GIL state for agent tool calls. This is the single most security-critical row in the matrix. |
| `TransportCodeExec` | **fail-closed** | Arbitrary code execution. A PolicyEval outage that allows-by-default here sidesteps the 21 Python + 9 JavaScript obfuscation detection categories — currently 57 + 36 compiled regex patterns (`adapters/codeexec/analyzer_python.go`, `analyzer_javascript.go`). |
| `TransportCLI` | **fail-closed** | Command execution with parsed pipe-chain risk classification (`adapters/cli/classifier.go`). Silently allowing on evaluator outage drops the high-risk classification results. |
| `TransportGRPC` | fail-closed | Unary RPC interceptor (`adapters/grpc/adapter.go:131-157`). Internal service surface; defaulting to fail-closed matches the rest of the control plane's default posture. |
| `TransportA2A` | fail-closed (with caveat) | A2A adapter is stub-level (see §6). If A2A is used in production at all, it should fail-closed until the adapter matures. |
| `TransportWebhook` | fail-open (with logging) | Webhook is intended for low-trust informational paths — health checks, notification dispatch, etc. Operators who use webhook for governed execution should override to fail-closed. |

The pipeline exercises this map with `p.failClosed[req.Transport]`
(`pipeline.go:190`), which is O(1) and never errors on unknown keys.

## 4. DryRun Mode Interaction

DryRun is configured via `PipelineConfig.DryRun` (`pipeline.go:23-28`). When
set, the deferred hook at `pipeline.go:118-130` applies **after** audit:

1. Pipeline runs all four stages exactly as in production mode.
2. On `return`, the deferred function fires:
   - Stopwatch is stopped (`pipeline.go:119`).
   - Audit event is published with the **real** action
     (`pipeline.go:120` → `pipeline.go:220-233`).
   - If `dryRun == true` and `decision.Action == "deny"`:
     - `decision.DryRun = true`
     - `decision.Reason = "DRY-RUN would deny: <original>"` (preserves the
       original reason under a prefix so callers can still reason about why
       the block would have fired).
     - `decision.Action = "allow"` (caller sees allow).

**Implications:**

- Audit logs in dry-run mode contain the ground-truth decision. They are the
  source of truth for "what would governance have blocked if dry-run were
  off?".
- Callers in dry-run mode see the rewritten action. Any SLO measurement that
  reads `decision.Action` from the caller side will under-count denies; any
  measurement that reads from the audit stream will count correctly.
- DryRun only rewrites `deny` → `allow`. Actions like `escalate`, `warn`,
  and `require_approval` are not touched (`pipeline.go:121`). This matches
  the semantics of "what would have blocked?" — non-terminal decisions
  would not have blocked.
- DryRun does **not** short-circuit any stage. All four stages still run, so
  dry-run has the same latency profile as production.

## 5. Fault-Injection Test Plan

One test case per DENY cell plus the parse-failure and fail-open edge cases.
"Status" column records whether the behavior is already covered by a test in
the current suite ("Existing") or is a new test to write post-YC ("New"). No
new tests are implemented by this PRD — this is a plan.

| Test ID | Fault Class | Transport | Setup | Expected | Status |

| FI-025 | PolicyEval error (fail-closed) | MCP | stub evaluator returns error; `FailClosedTransports = [TransportMCP]` | DENY, reason contains `policy evaluation failed (fail-closed)` | **Blocker**: stock `*policyeval.Evaluator` never returns error on non-nil requests (noted in `governance/pipeline_coverage_test.go:167-169`). Requires a test-only evaluator interface seam before the test can be written. |
| FI-026 | PolicyEval error (fail-closed) | CLI | same as FI-025 with `FailClosedTransports = [TransportCLI]` | DENY | Same blocker as FI-025 |

| FI-034 | DryRun rewrite preserves audit | any | `DryRun = true`; force a deny (blocked trust state); capture auditor events | audit event contains `action == "deny"`; caller sees `action == "allow"`, `DryRun == true`, `Reason` starts with `DRY-RUN would deny:` | New (no dedicated test today; `TestPipeline_AuditEventEmitted` at `governance/pipeline_test.go:237-269` exercises audit emission but not the dry-run branch) |

**Blocker note (FI-025 / FI-031):** the pipeline's fail-closed-vs-fail-open
branch at `governance/pipeline.go:189-195` is currently unreachable through
the public `*policyeval.Evaluator` type, because that evaluator does not
return an error for non-nil requests. Closing FI-025 through FI-031 requires
one of:

1. A test-only evaluator interface (extract the method signature into an
   interface the pipeline depends on, and inject a faulting stub in tests).
2. A genuine failure mode in `*policyeval.Evaluator` (e.g., database-backed
   policy fetch) that the pipeline can actually encounter.

Either is a code change, not documentation. Logged here rather than acted on.

## 6. Known Gaps and Recommendations

Four of the five gaps originally recorded here were remediated in PRD-004R.
Status is annotated inline. The A2A gap remains open.

- **A2A adapter is stub-level.** `adapters/a2a/adapter.go:1-6` declares the
  protocol "still evolving"; `ForwardGoverned`, `InspectResponse`, and
  `EmitGovernanceMetadata` are all no-ops (`:89-102`). The adapter parses
  task messages into `GovernanceRequest` with a minimal local schema; it
  does not integrate with Google A2A's actual wire protocol. Fail behavior
  in the matrix above is nominal (what the stub does), not
  production-tested. Treat A2A cells as "intended behavior" until the
  adapter matures.

- **[RESOLVED in PRD-004R Phase 4] Adapter-level parse failure is now typed.**
  Every adapter's `ParseRequest` returns `*governance.ParseError` on
  failure (`governance/errors.go`). Callers use `errors.As` or the
  convenience helper `governance.IsParseError(err)` to detect parse
  failures and route them through whatever deny-equivalent behavior their
  runtime wants. The underlying cause is preserved via `Unwrap`.
  Protocol-specific surface (HTTP 400 for webhook, `codes.Internal` for
  gRPC) still differs by design — the three-way split documented in §2 is
  correct for those transports — but MCP/CLI/CodeExec/A2A callers can now
  handle parse failures uniformly via the typed error, instead of
  string-matching adapter-specific messages.

- **[RESOLVED in PRD-004R Phase 1] `FailClosedTransports` default is no
  longer empty.** The kernel ships with `DefaultFailClosedTransports =
  [MCP, CodeExec, gRPC]`, applied when
  `PipelineConfig.FailClosedTransports == nil`. Operators who need
  fail-open everywhere must pass an explicit (non-nil) empty slice.
  See `governance/pipeline.go`.

- **[RESOLVED in PRD-004R Phase 2] PolicyEval error path is now reachable.**
  The pipeline now depends on a `PolicyEvaluator` interface rather than
  the concrete `*policyeval.Evaluator`. Tests inject an `errorEvaluator`
  stub that returns a synthetic error, which drives both the fail-closed
  (`TestPipeline_EvaluatorError_FailClosedTransport_Denies`) and fail-open
  (`TestPipeline_EvaluatorError_FailOpenTransport_Allows`) branches.
  FI-025 through FI-031 in §5 are now executable.

- **[RESOLVED in PRD-004R Phase 3] DryRun has dedicated coverage.** Four
  new tests in `governance/pipeline_dryrun_test.go` exercise the rewrite
  branch, including the security-critical audit-preservation invariant
  (`TestPipeline_DryRun_AuditPreservesOriginalDeny`) and the cross-cut
  with the Phase 2 evaluator seam
  (`TestPipeline_DryRun_FailClosedEvaluatorError_Rewritten`). FI-034 is now
  covered.
